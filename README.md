# Critical Particle Fix
Removes a stray pixel in the critical hit particle.

## More information
In the 1.14 update, particles were moved out of a singular file and each given their own, this was done to make it possible to add more particles in the future. In doing so, Mojang somehow accidentally added an extra pixel to the critical particle. They fixed this themselves on MC version 1.15.2 but due to the nature of updates and how they work, older versions of MC (1.14 to 1.15.1) will still have the pixel.

## Comparison
Below is an image which shows what the particle looks like before and after being modified.
